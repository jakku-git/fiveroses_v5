## Password Protection Systems

### 1. `/projects` Page (rifold2025)
**Location:** `app/projects/page.tsx`

**Details:**
- Uses `PasswordProtection` component with password: **"rifold2025"**
- Redirects to: `/projects/rifold` upon successful authentication
- Client-side only protection (can be bypassed)
- No persistent authentication (password required each visit)

**Content:**
The RIFOLD project showcases a comprehensive rebranding proposal for an Australian health supplements company, featuring:
- Brand identity transformation
- Packaging evolution (before/after)
- Digital transformation
- Full implementation timeline
- Premium wellness positioning strategy

### 2. `/work/*` Pages (xvii)
**Location:** `app/work/password/page.tsx` + `middleware.ts`

**Details:**
- Password: **"xvii"**
- Protected paths: `/work/marketing`, `/work/web-solutions`, `/work/creative-production`, `/work/incubator`
- Uses cookie-based authentication (`work-auth` cookie, expires 7 days)
- Server-side protection via Next.js middleware

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// middleware.ts protects these paths
if (Cookies.get('work-auth') === 'xvii') {
  // Allow access
}
```

## Critical Security Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API Key Logging Vulnerability

**File:** `app/api/contact/route.ts:9`

**Issue:**
```typescript
console.log('API Key:', process.env.RESEND_API_KEY); // This will be hidden in logs
```

**Severity:** HIGH
**Risk:** API credentials exposure in logs

**Impact:**
- Resend API key could be exposed in server logs
- Potential email service abuse
- Cost implications

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// REMOVE THIS LINE IMMEDIATELY
// console.log('API Key:', process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
```

### Weak Password Protection

**Issue:** Client-side password validation
- Passwords stored in plain text in component files
- `/projects` page can be bypassed by accessing the component directly
- No rate limiting on password attempts
- No server-side validation

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement server-side authentication
2. Use environment variables for sensitive passwords
3. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
4. Consider implementing JWT tokens for persistent sessions
5. Add CAPTCHA on password forms
